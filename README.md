# self-assert-react-demo

A demo for the [`self-assert`](https://github.com/self-assert/self-assert)
package. It is an attempt to replicate [Hernán Wilkinson](https://github.com/hernanwilkinson)'s example
of his webinar [Diseño a la Gorra](https://github.com/hernanwilkinson/disenioALaGorra), using the new library.

For more information, see [this reference](https://github.com/hernanwilkinson/disenioALaGorra/tree/a6d90a0044bf69f98fb50584872b226bf678e67b/Temporada01/Episodio03%20-%20Modelar%20los%20Conjuntos%20de%20Objetos).

Try the demo [ live on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/self-assert/self-assert-react-demo)
